# MeterReading

This is my implementation of the coding test. I ended up doing most of the spec but not getting a UI in place.
In the end I have created a .net api, a sql backend using EF core, unit test and test container integration tests.
You will find plan.md which has my rough notes.

## Things I would do next

1. Add a UI
1. Increase the number of integration and unit tests
1. General cleanup
1. Adding in logging to the app
1. Adding in docker compose with data setup, UI and api for local development.
1. Adding in a deployment pipeline using azure DO and terraform or bicep.

# Things I would do differently

1. I believe I over complicated this so doing a very rough iteration and using that to make UI and integration tests.
1. After that fixing structure and errors.
1. Then adding nice to haves like logging.
1. A more iterative approach with a rough alpha to start, then move from there.
